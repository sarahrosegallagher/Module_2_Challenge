# Module 2 Challenge: Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the performance of a selection of Green Energy stocks across two years (2017 and 2018) on the basis of yearly return and total daily volume. 

This analysis is designed to be friendly to the end-user in the following ways: 
* The outputs include only the required information rather than any background calculations.
* The user has buttons that can clear the sheet and run the analysis.
* Input boxes allow the user to adjust the year for analysis. 
* Formatting is automatically applied to the worksheet to enhance readability, including conditional formatting to color-code positive vs negative yearly returns.
* The code has been refactored for efficiency as checked by run time calculations, so that the same code may be effectively applied to larger data sets. 


## Results
### Stock Performance Across Years


### Impact of Refactoring on Execution Times
The main change I made in the process of refactoring the code was moving from nested for loops to using output arrays in order to handle the multiple outputs needed for the analysis. This allowed the code to be simplified into a single for loop. 


## Summary

### 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?

### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
